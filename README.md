Saving is the foundation for financial stability; setting aside a portion of monthly income for future expenses is the most intelligent way to ensure that we can meet our goals and be ready to cover any emergencies or the pleasures that we wish to give ourselves at a specific time.

But is this practice used by our generation?

Millennials who were born between 1981-1996 are now entering their productive years. However, We commonly refer to millennials as those who need help to get into the habit of saving. This is confirmed according to the study by Dahlia for Luno (Lunodiscover,2019) which reveals that 69% of the 7,000 millennials do not save regularly.

"Millennials do not have savings or much less a plan for their retirement, according to a recent survey by the company Fidelity. Even “older millennials” — defined by GBR as those between 25 and 34 — struggled to save money: 61 percent had less than $1,000 in their accounts and 41 percent had nothing at all" (Elkins, K. 2018).

What makes saving difficult for millennials?

The first factor is that these generations are currently in work stages where their incomes are not yet large enough to generate savings. If we add to this the fact that we live in a dynamic of consumption in which day-to-day expenses require many payments - from renting a house to subscriptions to various digital platforms - the salary received by younger people is mainly allocated to these expenses and, as a result, their ability to save is reduced.

Another factor is that many young people have the motto, "let's enjoy more and accumulate less". So, the more they enjoy and the less they accumulate, the more difficult it becomes for them to save.

We, as part of this generation, find this topic interesting because in our experience it is becoming more and more complicated to save, with the high cost of living, and the few well-paid jobs, it is difficult to cover the expenses we have every day, so allocating part of our income to savings is becoming more and more difficult. But we cannot categorise an entire generation as those with no future savings. Our experience may differ from that of the rest of the millennial population. For this reason, in this project, we want to understand what is happening with our generation concerning savings.
